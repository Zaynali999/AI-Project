##Rafay Rehman 63338 working on Naive Bayes (laplace smoothing)
The problems that i faced during this training was the removal of string data also following with data accuracy issues.
For solving the problems we used parameter tuning for problem solving and for applying parameter tuning we used grid search cv 
The results have improved before the accuracy was 58% which increased to 62%

#Umer Abdullah  working on KNN MODEL
Accuracy is half subsequent to expanding the neighbors , to gain proficiency with the libraries and boundaries of model
I utilized the google search and youtube to realize which model could be best for the given dataset So awesome.
precision we have in KNN by executing above boundaries and procedures And take the mean of 5 consective
upsides of cross validation.But KNN does'nt give great outcome on huge datasets .
