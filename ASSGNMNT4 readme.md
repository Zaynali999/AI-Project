##Rafay Rehman 63338 working on Naive Bayes (laplace smoothing)
The problems that i faced during this training was the removal of string data also following with data accuracy issues.
For solving the problems we used parameter tuning for problem solving and for applying parameter tuning we used grid search cv 
The results have improved before the accuracy was 58% which increased to 62%
